=====

This plugin is a revision of original [Bitbucket Pull Request Builder Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Bitbucket+pullrequest+builder+plugin).
It was started by adding support for [Bitbucket webhooks](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/manage-webhooks-735643732.html)
and resulted in massive rewrite and deleting the code.
